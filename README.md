# COVID-19-Prediction-Model
Predict future number of Covid cases based on the past number of cases

## Introduction
This machine learning system will learn the data and pattern of COVID cases based on the dataset collected from the official government dataset repository and modified by us and the online community to suit the design of the machine learning system. The result from the system is future prediction of the number of COVID cases whether it increases or decreases based on the pattern and calculation related like the R-Factor
